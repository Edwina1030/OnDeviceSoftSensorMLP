## ðŸ“„ Dataset Information

- **DS1.csv**:  
  A publicly available dataset from a system with a mud tank and Venturi structure. It includes **10 kHz** flow data from three level sensors, with Coriolis mass flowmeter readings as ground truth.  

- **Unavailable Datasets (DS2 & DS3)**:  
  These datasets, provided by **Viumdal et al.**, include **upward and downward flow trends** for enhanced evaluation but cannot be shared due to data ownership restrictions.  

## ðŸ›  Data Processing

- **EDA.ipynb**: Notebook for **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, including statistics and visualizations.  
- **data_process.py**: Data preprocessing script (e.g., cleaning, normalization).  
- **FlowDataset.py**: Custom dataset loader module for training workflows.
